# This template generates vacation messages for incoming mail. Make sure
# that ~/.vacation.msg exists and that 'vacation -i' has been run before 
# including this template. Also make sure that you set MYALIASES in the 
# calling procmailrc file to be a space-delimited list of all the email
# left-hand sides you receive email for (other than your username). All
# users MUST set at least one (their official email).
