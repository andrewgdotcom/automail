# This template manages the user's email settings via self-addressed emails.
# The automail executable is a perl script that edits your .procmailrc file
# and relies heavily on these templates.
# To get help on usage, enable this template and then send yourself an email
# with the subject "automail! help".

# This recipe delivers to your mailbox aswell, so that if you are hacked,
# you should notice.
# Automail marks all of its autoreplies as junk. Filter them out to avoid
# loops. The one reply not marked junk is the mail forward loop detection.
